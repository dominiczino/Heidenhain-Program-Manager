# Heidenhain-Program-Manager

Python script that manages files for Heidenhain TNC Server.
Takes named *.H files and maps them to numbered versions of the file so the TNC server can read them and pass the information on to the CNC control.

Note that this requires Python 2.8!

There's no reason it had to be Python 2.8, this was just running on an old version of windows that doesn't support Python 3+
